# CyclicalVAE

A state-of-the-art implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) leveraging **cyclical annealing schedules** to mitigate posterior collapse, a common issue in VAEs. This repository provides a modular, easy-to-use, and high-performance implementation designed to outperform publicly available VAE models.

## üöÄ Features

- **Cyclical Annealing**: Mitigates posterior collapse by dynamically adjusting the KL divergence weight (Œ≤) during training.
- **Customizable Architecture**: Easily modify encoder/decoder layers and latent space dimensions.
- **Scalable**: Supports both CPU and GPU training for datasets of varying sizes.
- **Visualization Tools**: Built-in utilities for visualizing latent space and reconstruction quality.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare with standard VAE implementations using pre-configured benchmarks.
